Hello, world!

This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which magically transforms markup files into static webpages. I'm writing posts in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and will be using [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) to typeset mathematics. This is the first time I've used Jekyll, so please bear with the rough edges. If you find an error or bug, [please let me know](mailto:yoshwakeham@gmail.com).

You can find all the source for the site on [GitHub](http://github.com/yoshw/yoshw.github.io), if you're curious. (All design elements are freely reusable under the MIT License, while the posts are under a Creative Commons attribution license -- see Github for details).

I've modelled various parts of the site on the personal sites of [Tate Johnson](http://tatey.com) and [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com), as well as taking some tips from [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/); anything you like about the design of this site is almost certainly due to those gentlemen.
