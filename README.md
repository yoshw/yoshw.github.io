# Data for Yoshua Wakeham's blog

This is source and data for Yoshua Wakeham's blog. It gets turned into a static website by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). You can visit the site at [yoshw.github.io](http://yoshw.github.io).

I've modelled various parts of the site on the personal sites of [Tate Johnson](http://tatey.com) and [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com), as well as taking some tips from [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/); full credit to those gentlemen for the design, layout and functionality of this site.
