Testing MathJax!

<div>
\begin{align*}
    x &= \int_0^1 \text{fancy maths}(\phi^2)\\
    \frac{n+1}{e^{-12}} &= \Sigma \text{beans}
\end{align*}
</div>

This is all very important mathematics, as you can see. We also want to ascertain that when the in-line $$n^2$$ tends to the in-line $$x_n$$, all my hair is preserved.
